# Road-Accident---Excel

##Project Description:
This project aims to analyze road accident data and derive meaningful insights by utilizing various KPIs and visualizations. The analysis focuses on understanding the patterns of casualties caused by different factors such as accident severity, vehicle types, road types, and lighting conditions. The project employs Excel’s advanced functionalities to create an interactive dashboard for better decision-making and reporting.

##Key Features of the Analysis:

##Primary KPIs:

#Accident Severity:

Fatal, serious, and slight accidents were analyzed to calculate total casualties.

Percentage distribution of casualties based on severity levels.

##Secondary KPIs:

#Vehicle Type:

Casualties were categorized by the type of vehicles involved (e.g., cars, motorcycles, buses).

Insights into which vehicle types contributed most to accidents.

##Visualizations:

#Line Chart:

Monthly trend of total casualties to identify peaks and patterns over the year.

#Bar Chart:

Casualties segmented by road types (e.g., highways, residential roads).

#Treemap:

Representation of casualties based on road surface conditions (e.g., dry, wet, icy).

#Donut Chart:

Comparison of casualties in rural and urban areas.

#Clustered Bar Chart:

Light condition impact on casualties, showcasing daylight and dark conditions.

##Interactivity:

#Timeline:

A timeline slicer to filter data by year, providing a dynamic view of trends over time.

#Slicer:

Area-based slicer to segregate data for rural and urban regions.

#Project Outcome:

Delivered a comprehensive Excel dashboard with interactive visualizations and data insights.

Identified key factors contributing to road accidents, aiding stakeholders in formulating better safety strategies.

Enabled data-driven decision-making through detailed and interactive analysis.
